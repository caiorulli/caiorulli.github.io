I've already (temporarily) given up on Rust, and my adventures with Haskell have shown me other possibilities regarding software abstraction. If you're interested in what kind place these other kinds of abstraction might lead, I highly recommend this Gabriel Gonzales' article.</description><pubDate>Wed, 09 Sep 2020 00:00:00 -0300</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://www.crthomaz.com.br/posts/2020-05-06-first/</guid><link>https://www.crthomaz.com.br/posts/2020-05-06-first/</link><title>Hello there!</title><description>General Kenobi!
