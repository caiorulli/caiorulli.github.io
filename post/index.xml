      <description>É tempo! Independência ou Morte! Estamos separados de Portugal!
 Rant in the woods On 2020 I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching lots of Luke Smith&amp;rsquo;s videos, among other Linux-related youtubers. Luke&amp;rsquo;s known to be a controversial figure, and he often wanders off the regular bash-and-vim routine to talk about something else, like this one, where talks about independence and life choices.

      <description>Hello there!  General Kenobi! You are a bold one&amp;hellip;
 Hey, so&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m thinking of making this my brain dump blog to just do some writing on tech/programming matters now and then. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how wide the subject range might be, but I&amp;rsquo;ll probably rant on things I&amp;rsquo;ve had to fix lately, or maybe some different things I&amp;rsquo;ve bumped into.
I could just write in Medium, but I guess I&amp;rsquo;m more comfortable here outside the grid.</description>
